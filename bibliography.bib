              faster on a quantum than a classical computer. However, if future
              quantum devices are to produce accurate calculations, errors due
              to environmental noise and algorithmic approximations need to be
              characterized and reduced. In this study, we use the high
              performance qHiPSTER software to investigate the effects of
              environmental noise on the preparation of quantum chemistry
              states. We simulated 18 16-qubit quantum circuits under
              environmental noise, each corresponding to a unitary coupled
              cluster state preparation of a different molecule or molecular
              configuration. Additionally, we analyze the nature of simple gate
              errors in noise-free circuits of up to 40 qubits. We find that,
              in most cases, the Jordan-Wigner (JW) encoding produces smaller
              errors under a noisy environment as compared to the Bravyi-Kitaev
              (BK) encoding. For the JW encoding, pure dephasing noise is shown
              to produce substantially smaller errors than pure relaxation
              noise of the same magnitude. We report error trends in both
              molecular energy and electron particle number within a unitary
              coupled cluster state preparation scheme, against changes in
              nuclear charge, bond length, number of electrons, noise types,

               Common examples of non-linear response forms include unimodal
               ``optimum-type'' responses and various saturating responses.
               These responses filter the signal coming from the environment to
               a corresponding biological process. We explored how different
               types of environmental signal may be transformed to a biological
               process. We were interested in the effect of the filter on
               modulation of (1) the variance of the signal, on (2) the
               variance-covariance structure between the signal and the
               filtered signal, and on (3) the match between the power spectra
               of the signal and the filtered signal. We found that the filters
               will change the frequency distribution (mean, variance,
               modality) of the signal. Especially symmetric filters that have
               a single peak of optimum will change signal structure so that
               there either exists or does not exist a correlation between the
               signal and the filtered signal. When the correlation exists it
               may be either positive or negative depending on the signal's
               mode relative to the filter structure. Also, the power spectrum
               properties of the signal may be dramatically transformed after
               passing the filter, e.g., blue noise can turn into red noise.
               Our results strongly suggest that studies on the influence of
               external signals on biological processes, such as population

               organisms to environment. They potentially modify the
               qualitative and quantitative properties of population dynamics.
               We studied how non-linear responses to environment, or ``noise
               filters'', influence population variability and extinction risk
               by introducing coloured noise to the growth rate in the Hassell
               single-species model. The consequences of noise filtering were
               analysed by comparing the model dynamics with linearly filtered
               and non-linearly filtered noise that have the same mean. Three
               biologically plausible filters we used: saturating, unimodal
               optimum type, and sigmoid responses. Filtering can either
               decrease or increase population variability when compared to
               linear noise response. The effect of noise filtering on
               variability is most pronounced with stable population dynamics
               and the outcome depends on the filter type, population growth
               rate, and noise colour. Non-linear noise filtering predominantly
               increases extinction risks when population growth rate is low (R
               < 5). As an exception, saturating filter has a window of
               decreased risk at very low growth rate and reddened environment.
               In the unstable range of the dynamics (15 < R < 25), the optimum
               and saturating type responses can decrease the extinction risk
               whereas the sigmoid response increases extinction risk. Noise
               filtering can also alter the route to extinction in slowly
               growing populations from slow to rapid decline towards
               extinction in optimum and saturating responses. These results
               suggest that accounting for the non-linear responses to
               environment should be considered when estimating extinction
               risks and population variability. Moreover, the non-linear
               responses make noise colour a more important factor in these
               analyses.]",

               the Moran effect, that is, shared environmental fluctuations
               across the region. In this article, I use a series of simple
               metapopulation models to show that the degree of synchrony among
               populations separated by different distances is strongly
               affected by the particular way that environmental stochasticity
               is represented in the models. Furthermore, when multiple types
               of stochasticity are acting simultaneously, the synchronizing
               effect of any one type is difficult to discern from the
               resulting pattern of population synchrony. These effects can be
               exacerbated under certain demographic conditions or if
               population dynamics are affected by interspecific interactions.
               In general, it should be extremely difficult to determine if

               with selecting detailed predictive models. A particularly
               difficult challenge is determining the relative role of
               deterministic versus stochastic forces in producing

               can, under broad and well-defined circumstances, elucidate
               drivers of population dynamics. We find that when neighbours are
               coupled (e.g. by dispersal), noisy intrinsic oscillations become
               distinguishable from noise-induced oscillations at a transition
               point related to synchronisation that is distinct from the

  abstract = "Many complex systems exhibit critical transitions. Of
              considerable interest are bifurcations, small smooth changes in
              underlying drivers that produce abrupt shifts in system state.
              Before reaching the bifurcation point, the system gradually loses
              stability ('critical slowing down'). Signals of critical slowing
              down may be detected through measurement of summary statistics,
              but how extrinsic and intrinsic noises influence statistical
              patterns prior to a transition is unclear. Here, we consider a
              range of stochastic models that exhibit transcritical,
              saddle-node and pitchfork bifurcations. Noise was assumed to be
              either intrinsic or extrinsic. We derived expressions for the
              stationary variance, autocorrelation and power spectrum for all
              cases. Trends in summary statistics signaling the approach of
              each bifurcation depend on the form of noise. For example, models
              with intrinsic stochasticity may predict an increase in or a
              decline in variance as the bifurcation parameter changes, whereas
              models with extrinsic noise applied additively predict an
              increase in variance. The ability to classify trends of summary
              statistics for a broad class of models enhances our understanding

  abstract = "Overexploitation of commercially beneficial fish is a serious
              ecological problem around the world. The growth profiles of most
              of the species are likely to follow density regulated
              theta-logistic model irrespective of any taxonomy group [Sibly et
              al., Science, 2005]. Rapid depletion of population size may cause
              reduced fitness, and the species is exposed to Allee phenomena.
              Here sustainability is addressed by modelling the herring
              population as a stochastic process and computing the probability
              of extinction and expected time to extinction. The models
              incorporate an Allee effect, crowding effect which reduce birth
              and death rates at large populations, and two possible choices of
              harvesting models viz. linear harvesting and nonlinear
              harvesting. A seminal attempt is made by Saha [Saha et al., Ecol.
              Model, 2013] for this economically beneficial fish, but ignored
              the vital phenomena of harvesting. Moreover, in this model, the
              demographic stochasticity is introduced through the white-noise
              term, which has certain limitations when harvesting is introduced
              into the system. White noise is appropriate for such a system
              where immigration and emigration are allowed, but a harvesting
              model is rational for a closed system. The demographic
              stochasticity is introduced by replacing an ordinary differential
              equation model with a stochastic differential equation model,
              where the instantaneous variance in the SDE is derived directly
              from the birth and death rates of a birth-death process. The
              modelling parameters are fit to data of the herring populations
              collected from Global Population Dynamics Database (GPDD), and
              the risk of extinction of each population is computed under
              different harvesting protocols. A threshold for handling times is
              computed beneath which the risk of extinction is high. This is
              proposed as a recommendation to management for sustainable
              harvesting.",

              high-frequency climate variability. However, it is not yet well
              understood how changing patterns of environmental variation will
              affect wildlife population dynamics and other ecological
              processes. Theory predicts that a population's long-run growth
              rate is diminished and the chance of population extinction is
              increased as environmental variation increases. This results from
              the fact that population growth is a multiplicative process and
              that long-run population growth rate is the geometric mean of
              growth rates over time, which is always less than the arithmetic
              mean. However, when population growth rates for unstructured
              populations are related nonlinearly to environmental drivers,
              increasing environmental variation can increase a population's
              long-run growth rate. This suggests that patterns of
              environmental variation associated with different aspects of
              climate change may affect population dynamics in different ways.
              Specifically, increasing variation in rainfall might result in
              diminished long-run growth rates for many animal species while
              increasing variation in temperature might result in increased
              long-run growth rates. While the effect of rainfall is
              theoretically well understood and supported by data, the
              hypothesized effect of temperature is not. Here, I analyse two
              datasets to study the effect of fluctuating temperatures on
              growth rates of zooplankton. Results are consistent with the
              prediction that fluctuating temperatures should increase long-run

               systems are highly desirable because it is often difficult to
               revert a system to the previous state once a transition has
               occurred. In this paper, two indicators, the phase lag and
               amplitude difference of the system's response, are extended to
               detect early-warning signals of a periodically driven, bistable
               complex system with noise. Our results show that both indicators
               can announce a regime shift of a complex system with small
               noise, namely, the critical point of the regime shift near a
               bifurcation point of the corresponding deterministic system.
               However, they fail to early indicate the regime shift in the
               case of large noise where the shift is far from the original
               bifurcation point. Based on the moment-expanding scheme, we
               reduce a large noise to a small one, and then both indicators

               eutrophication could be detected in advance by studying the

              considerable interest are bifurcations, small smooth changes in
              underlying drivers that produce abrupt shifts in system state.
              Before reaching the bifurcation point, the system gradually loses
              stability ('critical slowing down'). Signals of critical slowing
              down may be detected through measurement of summary statistics,
              but how extrinsic and intrinsic noises influence statistical
              patterns prior to a transition is unclear. Here, we consider a

              three types based on temporal scales and noise strengths of

              comparing three important time scales $\tau$($\lambda$),
              $\tau$(tran), and $\tau$(ergo), where $\tau$($\lambda$) is the
              time scale of parameter change (e.g., the change of environment),
              $\tau$(tran) is the time scale when a particle or state transits
              from a metastable state into another, and $\tau$(ergo) is the
              time scale when the system becomes ergodic. According to the time

  abstract = "Abstract Species populations are subjected to fluctuations in
              their surrounding environment, and the strength of these
              fluctuations has been hypothesized to be a major determinant of
              the extinction risk of these populations. Therefore, a key
              question is: How does temporal environmental variance affect the
              extinction risk of species populations? Previous theory based on
              the dynamics of single populations typically predicts an
              increased risk of extinction from the effects of environmental
              variance. However, previous studies have focused mainly on the
              case where environmental effects are temporally uncorrelated
              (white environmental noise), whereas such effects are typically
              correlated (colored environmental noise) in nature. Thus, further
              work on the case of colored environmental noise is required, but
              this has been hindered by the analytical intractability of
              corresponding stochastic models. In our study, we address this
              limitation by developing a new discrete-time Markov chain model
              of a species population fluctuating under colored environmental
              noise, with the simplification that the effects of demographic
              variance are manifested indirectly as an extinction threshold.
              This simplifying assumption allows us to derive analytical
              solutions, which show that the expected extinction time of model
              species declines with the strength of environmental variance
              under a variety of different scenarios, reflecting greater
              extinction risk. Our study thus clarifies the situations under
              which environmental variance tends to increase extinction risk,
              and provides a novel analytically tractable framework for
              modeling temporal environmental variance. We also discuss the

  title     = "{When can noise induce chaos and why does it matter: a critique}",
  author    = "Ellner, S P and Turchin, P",
  abstract  = "Noise-induced chaos illustrates how small amounts of exogenous
               noise can have disproportionate qualitative impacts on the long
               term dynamics of a nonlinear system. This property is
               particularly clear in chaotic systems but is also important for
               the majority of ecological systems which are nonchaotic, and has
               direct implications for analyzing ecological time series and
               testing models against field data. Dennis et al. point out that
               a definition of chaos which we advocated allows a
               noise-dominated system to be classified as chaotic when its
               Lyapunov exponent $\lambda$ is positive, which misses what is
               really going on. As a solution, they propose to eliminate the
               concept of noise-induced chaos: chaos ``should retain its
               strictly deterministic definition'', hence ``ecological
               populations cannot be strictly chaotic''. Instead, they suggest
               that ecologists ask whether ecological systems are strongly
               influenced by ``underlying skeletons with chaotic dynamics or
               whatever other dynamics''-- the skeleton being the hypothetical
               system that would result if all external and internal noise
               sources were eliminated. We agree with Dennis et al. about the
               problem -- noise-dominated systems should not be called chaotic
               -- but not the solution. Even when an estimated skeleton
               predicts a system's short term dynamics with extremely high
               accuracy, the skeleton's long term dynamics and attractor may be
               very different from those of the actual noisy system. Using
               theoretical models and empirical data on microtine rodent cycles
               and laboratory populations of Tribolium, we illustrate how data
               analyses focusing on attributes of the skeleton and its
               attractor -- such as the ``deterministic Lyapunov
               exponent''$\lambda$0 that Dennis et al. have used as their
               primary indicator of chaos -- will frequently give misleading
               results. In contrast, quantitative measures of the actual noisy
               system, such as $\lambda$, provide useful information for
               characterizing observed dynamics and for testing proposed
               mechanistic explanations.",

  abstract  = "Analysing the persistence and viability of small populations is
               a key issue in extinction theory and population viability
               analysis. However, there is still no consensus on how to
               quantify persistence and viability. We present an approach to
               evaluate any simulation model concerned with extinction. The
               approach is devised from general Markov models of stochastic
               population dynamics. From these models, we distil insights into
               the general mathematical structure of the risk of extinction by
               time t, P-0(t). From this mathematical structure, we devise a
               simple but effective protocol - the ln(1-P-0)-plot - which is
               applicable for situations including environmental noise or
               catastrophes. This plot delivers two quantities which are
               fundamental to the assessment of persistence and viability: the
               intrinsic mean time to extinction, T-m, and the probability c(1)
               of the population reaching the established phase. The
               established phase is characterized by typical fluctuations of
               the population's state variable which can be described by
               quasi-stationary probability distributions. The risk of
               extinction in the established phase is constant and given by
               1/T-m. We show that T-m is the basic currency for the assessment
               of persistence and viability because T-m is independent of
               initial conditions and allows the risk of extinction to be
               calculated for any time horizon. For situations where initial
               conditions are important, additionally c(1) has to be

              parameters to transition to far-away attractors. The terms
              ``critical transition'' or ``tipping point'' have been used to
              describe this situation. Critical transitions have been observed
              in an astonishingly diverse set of applications from ecosystems
              and climate change to medicine and finance. The main goal of this
              paper is to give an overview which standard mathematical theories
              can be applied to critical transitions. We shall focus on
              early-warning signs that have been suggested to predict critical
              transitions and point out what mathematical theory can provide in
              this context. Starting from classical bifurcation theory and
              incorporating multiple time scale dynamics one can give a
              detailed analysis of local bifurcations that induce critical
              transitions. We suggest that the mathematical theory of
              fast--slow systems provides a natural definition of critical
              transitions. Since noise often plays a crucial role near critical
              transitions the next step is to consider stochastic fast--slow
              systems. The interplay between sample path techniques, partial
              differential equations and random dynamical systems is
              highlighted. Each viewpoint provides potential early-warning
              signs for critical transitions. Since increasing variance has
              been suggested as an early-warning sign we examine it in the
              context of normal forms analytically, numerically and
              geometrically; we also consider autocorrelation numerically.
              Hence we demonstrate the applicability of early-warning signs for

  abstract = "An important component of the mathematical definition of chaos is
              sensitivity to initial conditions. Sensitivity to initial
              conditions is usually measured in a deterministic model by the
              dominant Lyapunov exponent (LE), with chaos indicated by a
              positive LE. The sensitivity measure has been extended to
              stochastic models; however, it is possible for the stochastic
              Lyapunov exponent (SLE) to be positive when the LE of the
              underlying deterministic model is negative, and vice versa. This
              occurs because the LE is a long-term average over the
              deterministic attractor while the SLE is the long-term average
              over the stationary probability distribution. The property of
              sensitivity to initial conditions, uniquely associated with
              chaotic dynamics in deterministic systems, is widespread in
              stochastic systems because of time spent near repelling invariant
              sets (such as unstable equilibria and unstable cycles). Such
              sensitivity is due to a mechanism fundamentally different from
              deterministic chaos. Positive SLE's should therefore not be
              viewed as a hallmark of chaos. We develop examples of ecological
              population models in which contradictory LE and SLE values lead
              to confusion about whether or not the population fluctuations are
              primarily the result of chaotic dynamics. We suggest that
              ``chaos\{''\} should retain its deterministic definition in light
              of the origins and spirit of the topic in ecology. While a
              stochastic system cannot then strictly be chaotic, chaotic

              Given an identical equilibrium population size and basic

               limiting our ability to accurately predict the spread of Zika.
               We conducted experiments to estimate the thermal performance of
               Zika virus (ZIKV) in field-derived Aedes aegypti across eight
               constant temperatures. We observed strong, unimodal effects of

               global estimates on the environmental suitability for Zika are

              characterize temperature-dependent transmission of 10
              vector--pathogen pairs of mosquitoes ( Culex pipiens , Cx.
              quinquefascsiatus , Cx. tarsalis , and others) and viruses (West

              Encephalitis, Sindbis, and Rift Valley Fever viruses), most with
              substantial transmission in temperate regions. Transmission is
              optimized at intermediate temperatures (23--26°C) and often has
              wider thermal breadths (due to cooler lower thermal limits)
              compared to pathogens with predominately tropical distributions
              (in previous studies). The incidence of human West Nile virus
              cases across US counties responded unimodally to average summer
              temperature and peaked at 24°C, matching model-predicted optima
              (24--25°C). Climate warming will likely shift transmission of

  abstract  = "The ecology of mosquito vectors and malaria parasites affect the
               incidence, seasonal transmission and geographical range of
               malaria. Most malaria models to date assume constant or linear
               responses of mosquito and parasite life-history traits to
               temperature, predicting optimal transmission at 31 °C. These
               models are at odds with field observations of transmission
               dating back nearly a century. We build a model with more
               realistic ecological assumptions about the thermal physiology of
               insects. Our model, which includes empirically derived nonlinear
               thermal responses, predicts optimal malaria transmission at 25
               °C (6 °C lower than previous models). Moreover, the model
               predicts that transmission decreases dramatically at
               temperatures > 28 °C, altering predictions about how climate
               change will affect malaria. A large data set on malaria
               transmission risk in Africa validates both the 25 °C optimum and
               the decline above 28 °C. Using these more accurate nonlinear
               thermal-response models will aid in understanding the effects of
               current and future temperature regimes on disease transmission.

  abstract = "Mosquito-borne diseases cause a major burden of disease
              worldwide. The vital rates of these ectothermic vectors and
              parasites respond strongly and nonlinearly to temperature and
              therefore to climate change. Here, we review how trait-based
              approaches can synthesise and mechanistically predict the
              temperature dependence of transmission across vectors, pathogens,
              and environments. We present 11 pathogens transmitted by 15
              different mosquito species -- including globally important
              diseases like malaria, dengue, and Zika -- synthesised from
              previously published studies. Transmission varied strongly and
              unimodally with temperature, peaking at 23--29ºC and declining to
              zero below 9--23ºC and above 32--38ºC. Different traits
              restricted transmission at low versus high temperatures, and
              temperature effects on transmission varied by both mosquito and
              parasite species. Temperate pathogens exhibit broader thermal
              ranges and cooler thermal minima and optima than tropical
              pathogens. Among tropical pathogens, malaria and Ross River virus
              had lower thermal optima (25--26ºC) while dengue and Zika viruses
              had the highest (29ºC) thermal optima. We expect warming to
              increase transmission below thermal optima but decrease
              transmission above optima. Key directions for future work include
              linking mechanistic models to field transmission, combining
              temperature effects with control measures, incorporating trait
              variation and temperature variation, and investigating climate
              adaptation and migration.",
