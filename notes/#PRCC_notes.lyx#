\begin_layout Title
Sensitivity Analysis of Static Quantities Derived from Dynamical Systems
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x'=f\left(x,t;p,\sigma\right)$
\end_inset

 be our dynamical system where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is our set of parameters and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

 is our level of noise (any of these quantities may be vectors).
 For now, let's assume there is no noise in the system (
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma=0$
\end_inset

) and we'll come back to the case with nosie later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We are often interested in static quantities derived from such systems such
 as the values of any equlibria, the stability of the equilibria, or more
 domain-specific quantities like the basic reproduction number.
 These quantities are called static because they are independent of time
 (you might also call them autonomous).
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 be the static quantity we're interested in: 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=g\left(p\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Here 
\begin_inset Formula $p=\left(p_{1},\ldots,p_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

 might include our set of initial conditions which can also be thought of
 like parameters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We're interested in better understanding the effect of the variation of
 parameters on the quantity 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
 For example, if 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 changes a lot with only a small change in 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

, then we need to make sure our estimate of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

 is really accurate because inaccuracy in 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}$
\end_inset

 will lead to more inaccuracy in 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
 On the other hand, if 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 barely changes as 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 is varied, then we don't have to focus as much on 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 and, in fact, may be able to find a way to exclude 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{2}$
\end_inset

 from our model.
 However, the function 
\begin_inset Formula $g$
\end_inset

 can be quite complicated and we may have many parameters we're interested
 in studying.
 We can't simply plot 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=g\left(p\right)$
\end_inset

 to understand how 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 depends on the values of 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

.
 We need a way to measure the relative influence of the parameters on 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Local Sensitivity Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\begin_inset Formula $\textit{local sensitivity}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 with respect to the parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 is defined to be
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\mathscr{S}_{Q}^{p_{i}}=\frac{\partial Q}{\partial p_{i}}
\]

\end_inset

This is called local because we can only evaluate this for a particular
 set of parameter values; we're not exploring the entire parameter space.
 If we're reasonably confident in the values of all the parameters, then
 a local sensitivity analysis is a good way to understand which parameters
 have the greatest influence on 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
 However, this approach is very dependent on the magnitude of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 is measured in kilometers and 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{j}$
\end_inset

 in meters, we would expect a relatively small change in 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 to have a larger impact on 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 than a large change in 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{j}$
\end_inset

.
 We can resolve this considering instead the 
\begin_inset Formula $\textit{elasticity}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\varepsilon_{Q}^{p_{i}}=\left(\frac{p_{i}}{Q}\right)\frac{\partial Q}{\partial p_{i}}\approx\frac{\%\Delta Q}{\%\Delta p_{i}}
\]

\end_inset

 This measures the percentage change in the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 due to a 
\begin_inset Formula $1\%$
\end_inset

 change in 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 This is still a local measure of influence but is more appropriate for
 comparing influence among the full set of parameters.
 These both measure the 
\begin_inset Formula $\textit{monotonicity}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 with respect to 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathscr{S}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\varepsilon$
\end_inset

 are positive (negative), then 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 increases (decreases) with 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

.
 We can calculate the full set of elasticities,
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ \varepsilon_{Q}^{p_{i}}\right\} _{i=1}^{n}$
\end_inset

 , and order them to see which parameters are most influential on the value
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Global Sensitivity Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But what if we are really unsure about our parameter values? Or we want
 to explore a model that can be applied to a wide range of systems ( = parameter
 sets)? The goal of a 
\begin_inset Formula $\textit{global sensitivity analysis}$
\end_inset

is to understand how 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is influenced by parameters through the whole parameter space.
 Exploring parameter space can quickly become daunting beyond two parameter.
 Consider the equation 
\begin_inset Formula $Q=x^{2}y+xz$
\end_inset

.
 We could maybe draw some level sets of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 in three dimensions to get an idea of what's going on but we'll only get
 a part of the picture.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To start a global sensitivity analysis, we have to decide on the parameter
 space we want to explore.
 There are two philosophies here: 1) parameters represent real quantities
 with uncertainty and 2) we should explore the full feasible range of the
 parameters.
 In the first case, we specify the distributions for each parameter e.g.
 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1}\sim N\left(\mu,\sigma^{2}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 In the second case, we specify the feasible intervals for each parameter
 i.e.
 
\begin_inset Formula $m_{i}\le p_{i}\le M_{i}$
\end_inset

 for 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,\ldots,n$
\end_inset

.
 While we could try to evaluate 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 for all the 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

's through their feasible ranges, this quickly gets memory and time intensive
 with any meaningful level of resolution beyond, say, 4 inputs.
 So in practice, we also treat the 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

's as random variables in this case, with 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}\sim\textrm{Uniform}\left(m_{i},M_{i}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 So from now on, think of 
\begin_inset Formula $P=\left(p_{1},\ldots,p_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

 as a random variable.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Latin Hypercube Sampling
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now need to evaluate our output function across our parameter values.
 As I said previously, even at relatively low dimensions this becomes a
 very intensive process.
 Latin Hypercube Sampling provides a method to systematically explore the
 entire parameter space in an efficient manner.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{1},\ldots,p_{n}$
\end_inset

 be our parameters.
 Suppose that we want to collect 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 samples of each parameter.
 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 should be large so that we get a good cross-section of our parameter values.
 But if we just take 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 samples of each parameter, we'll have to calculate the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 a total of 
\begin_inset Formula $K^{n}$
\end_inset

 times.
 If we have 
\begin_inset Formula $n=3$
\end_inset

 parameters that we want 
\begin_inset Formula $K=1000$
\end_inset

 samples of and each evaluation of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 takes 
\begin_inset Formula $0.001$
\end_inset

 seconds, this would take 
\begin_inset Formula $\sim277$
\end_inset

 hours!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Latin Hypercube Sampling is a method to efficiently explore the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

full
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 parameter space in only 
\begin_inset Formula $nK$
\end_inset

 evaluations (with the example above, this would take only 3 seconds!).
 How does this work? Here's a picture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align center
\begin_inset Graphics
	filename pasted1.png

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each parameter, divide it's range into 
\begin_inset Formula $K$
\end_inset

 sub-intervals so that each interval has equal probability.
 For a uniform distribution, this amounts to a simple dividing of the interval.
 For a normal distribution, notice how the sub-intervals containing higher
 probability densities are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

thinner
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 Now from each sub-interval, sample one point according to the probability
 distribution.
 After this we end up with a set of 
\begin_inset Formula $nK$
\end_inset

 parameter samples 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ p_{i,j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $i=1,\ldots,n$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $j=1,\ldots,K$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Calculating sensitivity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We now have a set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ p_{i,j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 of inputs which give us the set 
\begin_inset Formula $\left\{ Q_{j}\right\} $
\end_inset

 of outputs.
 We can instead think of these as matrices:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X=\begin{bmatrix}p_{11} & \ldots & p_{n1}\\
p_{12} & \ldots & p_{n2}\\
\vdots & \ddots & \ldots\\
p_{1K} & \ldots & p_{nK}
\end{bmatrix},Y=\begin{bmatrix}Q_{1}\\
Q_{2}\\
\vdots\\
Q_{K}
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\end_inset

Now remember, we're thinking of 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 as a random variable.
 What are the rows of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

? These are simply samples of the random variable 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is some function of these random variables and hence is itself a random
 variable; the rows of 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 are samples of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
 Now how do we measure the strength of a relationship between two random
 variables?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Correlation and partial correlation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With two random variables, an input 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and output 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

, we measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\textit{correlation}$
\end_inset

, the strength of the 
\series bold
linear 
\series default
relationship between these two random variables as
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c_{XY}=\frac{\textrm{Cov}\left(X,Y\right)}{\sqrt{\textrm{Var}\left(X\right)\textrm{Var}\left(Y\right)}}=\frac{E\left[XY\right]-E\left[X\right]E\left[Y\right]}{\sqrt{E\left[X^{2}\right]-E\left[X\right]^{2}}\sqrt{E\left[Y^{2}\right]-E\left[Y\right]^{2}}}
\]

\end_inset

which is also called the 
\begin_inset Formula $\textit{Pearson correlation coefficient}$
\end_inset

.
 Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $-1\le c_{XY}\le1$
\end_inset

.
 In fact, if 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{XY}=1$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $Y=aX+b$
\end_inset

 (similarly if 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{XY}=-1$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $Y=-aX+b$
\end_inset

).
 In other words, in this case there is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

perfect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 linear relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{XY}=0$
\end_inset

, then there is no linear relationship between the random variables.
 Note that this does 
\series bold
not
\series default
 mean there is 
\series bold
no 
\series default
relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example*
Here's a cute counter-example: let 
\begin_inset Formula $X\sim N\left(0,1\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left[X\right]=E\left[X^{3}\right]=0$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $Y=X^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Cov}\left(X,Y\right)=E\left[XY\right]-E\left[X\right]E\left[Y\right]=E\left[X^{3}\right]-E\left[X\right]E\left[Y\right]=0$
\end_inset

.
 But 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is clearly dependent on 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
But we don't just want to understand the influence of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 on 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

, we want to know how the parts of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 (the 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

's) influence 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

.
 For this, we can calculate 
\begin_inset Formula $\textit{partial correlation coefficients}$
\end_inset

.
 Partial correlation characterizes the 
\series bold
linear 
\series default
relationship between parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 after the linear effects on 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 of the remaining parameters are discounted.
 The partial correlation coefficient between 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 is the correlation coefficient between the two residuals 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(p_{i}-\hat{p_{i}}\right)$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(Q-\hat{Q}\right)$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p}_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{Q}$
\end_inset

 are the linear regression models:
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align*}
\hat{p_{i}} & =c_{0}+\sum_{j=1,j\ne i}^{n}c_{j}p_{j}\\
\hat{Q} & =b_{0}+\sum_{j=1,j\ne i}^{n}b_{j}p_{j}
\end{align*}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So correlation tells us whether there is a strong, 
\series bold
linear
\series default
 relationship between our input and output and we can compute it even for
 individual inputs.
 But ruling out a linear relationship, there can still be strong correlations
 (in the general sense) between variables.
 Consider our example from above: we would want to be able to detect that
 when 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 increases, so does 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

(when 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 is positive) because we know what 
\begin_inset Formula $Y=X^{2}$
\end_inset

 looks like.
 This sort of relationship is called 
\series bold
monotonic
\series default
: when one quantity increases (decreases) when another quantity increases.
 If we aim more broadly and don't insist on a linear relationship, we can
 actually learn more.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Rank correlation coefficients
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Going from 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

regular
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 correlation coefficients to rank correlation is pretty simple.
 All we do is replace the actual values of our input and output samples
 with their relative 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

rank
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 if we sorted them in increasing order.
 So we might end up with new matrices that look like
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
X_{R}=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 7 & 3\\
2 & 6 & 4\\
12 & 5 & 1\\
5 & 4 & 10\\
\vdots & \ddots & \ldots\\
3 & \ldots & 20
\end{bmatrix},Y_{R}=\begin{bmatrix}12\\
8\\
1\\
5\\
\vdots\\
2
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\end_inset

Note that for 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 we are doing the sort in each column (remember, column 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

 corresponds to parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $i$
\end_inset

).
 We've basically thrown out all the information besides the relative size
 of quantity.
 If large values of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 are associated with large values of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

 and small values of 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 with small values of 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

, then that is evidence of a monotonic relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $p_{i}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Q$
\end_inset

.
 Notice how this could detect the relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y=X^{2}$
\end_inset

 in the example above because now we are essentially forcing step sizes
 between adjacent values of 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Section*
Variance-based Sensitivity Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We'll talk more about this later.
 The general idea behind these methods is that variation in parameters results
 in variation in the output.
 We want to isolate how much of the variance in the output is due to variation
 in a given parameter, a process called variance decomposition.
 These method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's start from the most general set up.
 Think of a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

model
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 simply as the description of a relationship between some inputs and some
 outputs.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{y}=\left(y_{1},\ldots,y_{m}\right)$
\end_inset

 be the set of outputs we're interested in with 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}=\left(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}\right)$
\end_inset

 our inputs.
 A model can be described as a function from our space of inputs (and some
 additional stuff) to the space of outputs, 
\begin_inset Formula $f:X\to Y$
\end_inset

.
 Now if we want to be more sophisticated, we should take into account that
 our model likely depends on some other parameters we did not or cannot
 measure, call them 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta=\left(\theta_{1},\ldots,\theta_{k}\right)$
\end_inset

 as well as some randomness that we can't git rid of, 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

.
 Then we basically have
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\vec{y}=f\left(\vec{x};\theta,\sigma\right)
\]

\end_inset

The function 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 could be derived mechanistically: encapsulating ideas about how we think
 the entries of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}$
\end_inset

 affect 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{y}$
\end_inset

.
 Or, like with a stastical model, we simply assume that each input has a
 linear or multiplicative effect on the output.
 We might even just describe 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 as the map that takes our measured inputs to our measured outputs (like
 from a spreadsheet).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 are low-dimensional and 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 is a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

simple
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 function, we can just inspect 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 directly to describe how the entries of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{x}$
\end_inset

 affect any of the entries of 
\begin_inset Formula $\vec{y}$
\end_inset

.
 But generally, models are more complicated; input variables may interact
 with each other in complex, non-linear ways which can hide their effect
 on the outputs we're interested in.
 We to somehow account for variation in all the inputs (not to mention that
 our parameters 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 might be wrong, or we're dealing with noise 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma$
\end_inset

) when evaluating their influence on the outputs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
What is correlation?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let's say we just have two values, an input 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and output 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

.
 Correlation measures the strength of the linear relationship between these
 two random variables:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
c_{XY}=\frac{\textrm{Cov}\left(X,Y\right)}{\sqrt{\textrm{Var}\left(X\right)\textrm{Var}\left(Y\right)}}
\]

\end_inset

Using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we know that 
\begin_inset Formula $-1\le c_{XY}\le1$
\end_inset

.
 In fact, if 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{XY}=1$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $Y=aX+b$

 (similarly if 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{XY}=-1$
\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $Y=-aX+b$
\end_inset

).
 In other words, in this case there is a

perfect

\end_inset

 linear relationship between 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{XY}=0$
\end_inset

, then there is no linear relationship between the random variables.
 Note that this does

 mean there is

relationship between

\begin_layout Standard
Here's a cute counter-example: let 
\begin_inset Formula $X\sim N\left(0,1\right)$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $E\left[X\right]=E\left[X^{3}\right]=0$
\end_inset

.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $Y=X^{2}$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{Cov}\left(X,Y\right)=E\left[XY\right]-E\left[X\right]E\left[Y\right]=E\left[X^{3}\right]-E\left[X\right]E\left[Y\right]=0$
\end_inset

.
 But 
\begin_inset Formula $Y$
\end_inset

 is clearly dependent on 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
